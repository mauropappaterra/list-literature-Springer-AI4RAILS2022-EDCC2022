## Abstract
This literature review aims for a holistic overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in the railway industry. Our research covers specifically the subdomain of railway maintenance. We have analyzed the state of the art of AI applied to the railway industry by conducting an extensive literature review, summarizing different tasks and problems belonging to railway maintenance and common AI-based models implemented for their solution. Within this study we present an integrated overview with special emphasis on the data used to create these models.

The results of our research show that the possible applications of AI for the maintenance of railway operations are vast and there are many problems and tasks that can greatly benefit from it. Moreover, very different types of data are implemented to feed AI models: including not only numerical, text and image data but a wide variety of data types ranging from sound, GPS coordinates, track geometry, speed and acceleration data, data from rolling stock vibrations, knowledge from experts, historical data from logs and reports, temperature data and more. Data can also be harvested using different technologies such as IoT devices, wireless networks, smart sensors, computer-based simulations, and digital twins. These and more insights are discussed in detail within this paper.
